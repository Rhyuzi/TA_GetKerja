1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,520
Will he find out?

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,350
The president arranged this date because he is interested in my older sister right?

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,530
Do I look 23 years old?

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,350
Well, his eyes aren't that good so maybe we can trick him.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,220
That being said, this good deed will get us ahead.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,280
The other party is the Takaba group. The biggest conglomerate.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,970
My older sister has a boyfriend right now!

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,390
Having your daughter marry someone just for a high status is shameful!

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,230
Stop acting like you know everything!

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,090
Listen up!

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,300
Don't contradict me here!

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,960
You need to speak politely.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
Do you understand?

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,660
Well, since this is an arranged date..

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,000
He's probably a dwarf that nobody likes.

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,930
My older sister is always right.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,660
Pardon us.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,410
We can start the arranged date.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,970
Thanks for waiting Nonomura-kun.

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,790
Yes! Today I was granted a favor and I have come to offer my daughter from my Charcoal company!

21
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,990
I'm very grateful for this opportunity!

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,190
Sorry about asking you for this favor out of nowhere.

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,880
Takane. Hurry and come in.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,190
I didn't expect him to be a hottie! What am I going to do?

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,250
This is my grandson Takane.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,940
Wow...this is Takaba Takane-sama!

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,740
Thank you for today. Please take care of you...me.

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,750
Of me..

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,150
It's not Takaba!

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm Saibara Takane.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,310
Oh no...what have I done?

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,280
Please forgive me!

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,590
Now, now.

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,510
This is my daughter Yukari.

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,340
Nice to meet you Yukari-san.

36
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,230
Please take care of me.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,610
They're such outstanding young people!

38
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,930
They are prefect for each other!

39
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,790
A normal and humble girl is more suitable for him.

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,350
In the near future Takane...is going to be the head of the Takaba group.

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,200
He is still not familiar with a lot of things.

42
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,070
In order for him to work harder he needs to have some good help.

43
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,200
Thank you!

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,110
Come on Takane. Greet them too.

45
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,970
This person doesn't look like her pictures at all!

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,130
Way too much makeup!

47
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,790
Young people from the big cities wear makeup nowadays.

48
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,880
I really dislike women who put on such thick layers of makeup in order to seduce men.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,640
What are you saying?

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,830
Your face is not going to look any better even if you smile.

51
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,300
Takane!

52
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,960
Even if you wear a fancy Kimono that normal people have access too...

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,640
Did you think my family would start emptying our pockets for you?

54
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,370
You sure underestimated me didn't you?

55
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,630
That's enough!

56
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,000
She's just a gold digger trying to get some big bucks!

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,640
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

58
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,200
Shut the hell up and open those little ears for me!

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,060
Hana...no...Yukari! Yukari!

60
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,900
Sorry but...

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,930
I don't have the slightest interest in you at all big boy!

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,980
Hana!

63
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,730
I'm sorry!

64
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm sorry! Umm..

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,350
I'm sorry about this...

66
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:35,770
Translated, subbed and timed by Rjgman56.

67
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,040
My Dad probably got fired from his company...

68
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,330
It's okay!

69
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,450
Right, Mizuki?

70
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,510
That's right!

71
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,340
Let's go to Okamoto's place to cheer you up!

72
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,040
Let's do that!

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,050
Hey! Look at that car!

74
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,280
Isn't that amazing?

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,450
Do you know him?

76
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,070
He was at the arranged date yesterday.

77
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,940
Is he the rich heir?

78
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,480
He's coming over here!

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,260
You over there!

80
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,450
You really played me the other day at the arranged date.

81
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,560
And you're still a high school student...

82
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,030
How did you find out?

83
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,640
Who do you think I am?

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,480
The heir to the Takaba group?

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,020
That is me!

86
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,610
And I've come out of my way to see you.

87
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,940
I didn't ask you to though!

88
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,590
Wh...

89
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
I'll give this to you.

90
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,650
You've never gotten such a gorgeous bouquet of flowers before right?

91
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,730
I refuse! Pardon me!

92
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,520
Wait!

93
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,510
You came here to get revenge on me for yesterday right?

94
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,490
You're easy to read!

95
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,920
Does your Dad really want to quit his job I wonder?

96
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,320
Is this black mail?

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,810
You want him to work until he retires right?

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,660
Now then! Get in!

99
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,290
Sorry! I'll be going okay?

100
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,330
What's going on?

101
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,420
I don't know.

102
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,660
Hana had an arranged date with him.

103
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,970
An arranged date?

104
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,810
Saiba-sama.

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,130
Thanks for waiting.

106
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,660
Go ahead.

107
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,820
I cannot accept these expensive clothes.

108
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,050
Who said that I was going to give them to you? You're so cheeky!

109
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,180
You probably don't know this but...

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,350
This restaurant has a dress code that you need to follow.

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,920
Yeah, yeah! I didn't know that anyways!

112
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,230
Did you say anything?

113
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,010
No!

114
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,920
This is super premium Kobe beef.

115
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,450
This is the first time I've seen someone eat it like a pig!

116
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,540
Is that a thank you I hear?

117
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,020
You've probably never eaten this before have you?

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,740
Close your mouth and eat it, porky!

119
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,300
It is true that you have to eat high quality food more neatly.

120
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,190
But why did you invite me out anyways?

121
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,630
You found out that I'm in high school.

122
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,150
I don't have anything to do with you anymore!

123
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,480
Is it because you're a lonely boy?

124
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,330
Let me tell you something!

125
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,600
I've never been bothered by women!

126
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,390
You said it didn't you?

127
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm coming to get my sweet revenge!

128
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,050
You're not going to tell me that you don't like tomatoes right?

129
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,340
Are you a little kid?

130
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll eat them later.

131
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,800
You're a little kid!

132
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,850
It's not good if you don't eat them!

133
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,610
Tomatoes have Lycopene which can help reduce fatigue.

134
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,190
I'm different than the average person who refuses to eat them.

135
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,280
I want to enjoy the taste of the tomatoes on the side instead of blended with everything else.

136
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,170
I'm not the same as you!

137
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,640
Thanks for the meal!

138
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,610
I'll give you back these clothes after I wash them.

139
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,340
It's fine.

140
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,200
You can have them.

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,330
But you just said..

142
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,360
Yesterday...

143
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,720
I said that you were wearing too much makeup...

144
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,240
And I said a lot of unreasonable things.

145
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,190
Sorry....

146
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
I said I'm sorry!

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,590
After all of that...I heard that my grandfather was the one who arranged all of it.

148
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,080
I'm deeply sorry as well for what I did.

149
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,980
Later.

150
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,040
Umm...Is it possible...

151
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,670
That you came here to make amends?

152
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,230
Like hell I did!

153
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,890
Alright, I'm going!

154
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,140
I'm home.

155
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,030
What's up with those clothes?

156
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,140
Did you do something bad?

157
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,720
There's no way that I did!

158
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,680
I met Takane-san.

159
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,730
Takane-san?

160
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,780
From yesterday?

161
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,950
He's not angry?

162
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,390
That's what it seems like.

163
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,870
He's not?

164
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,900
I'll see you again on your next off day. You don't have to wear your clown makeup.

165
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,920
Good afternoon.

166
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,090
Wow, you have a talent for looking plain.

167
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,740
This is how I normally dress.

168
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,460
Is this how poor people dress?

169
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,970
It's a popular fashion style!

170
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,040
By the way Takane-san. What kind of job are you going to pursue?

171
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,050
What the?

172
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,290
I thought you didn't have any interest in me sweety?

173
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
You really are a rich second generation boy.

174
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,840
You just have your parents throw all their money on your lap.

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,920
You live your life without any worries.

176
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,800
You really have the mouth of the devil himself.

177
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,230
You have pretty high specs and you should be popular...

178
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,420
But I wonder why you're the lone ranger over here?

179
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,700
Women are just a bunch of gold diggers!

180
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,090
There's a reason why you're so popular with gold diggers.

181
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,170
It's because the only thing you have going for you is your money.

182
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,980
What does a little preschooler like you know about someone like me?

183
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,960
Welcome!

184
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,750
I'll take your order.

185
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,750
I'll get the beef meal set.

186
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,080
Yes.

187
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,200
I'll have the spaghetti with tomato sauce meal set.

188
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
Understood.

189
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,180
Tomato...

190
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,970
Please meet my older sister next time.

191
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,520
She's a beautiful girl that would have no problem dating someone foul mouthed like you.

192
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,500
You guys are the same age and your personalities suit each other. Like two peas in a pod.

193
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,840
Well...she does have a boyfriend so she might reject you though.

194
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,850
So basically you are saying that someone like you doesn't deserve to be with me?

195
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,110
How far is your head up your butt?

196
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,230
It's fine isn't it?

197
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,530
You have an inferiority complex, I get it.

198
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,030
Everyone has been biased towards me and your older sister.

199
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,970
What the heck?

200
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,360
Inferiority is a good thing.

201
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,110
Sometimes people aren't satisfied with the way that things are and achieve great things.

202
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,480
Do you have some kind of complex as well?

203
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,570
I do.

204
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,670
Yeah right!

205
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,380
Having a complex is impossible for someone like me!

206
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
You are a rich boy after all.

207
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,320
Everything is smooth sailing for you but I'm hitting all your points today.

208
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm so happy that I'm an ordinary person!

209
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,400
Don't worry.

210
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,300
Even you have your good points.

211
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,910
You have that fierceness and wise-ass attitude that just hits the spot.

212
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,060
That isn't a compliment!

213
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,800
I have come out of my way to see you again.

214
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,630
Be more confident.

215
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,090
You were so happy when I told you that weren't you?

216
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,580
Not in a million years!

217
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,880
Saibara-kun..

218
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,160
General manager!

219
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,200
Good work!

220
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,520
Are you on a date by any chance?

221
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,170
That isn't the case.

222
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,420
Hey Saibara-kun.

223
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,430
You're the only heir to the Takaba group.

224
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,370
Shouldn't you pick someone with a better appeal and charm?

225
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,030
You don't need to worry about that.

226
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Thank you for today.

227
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,640
Takane-san.

228
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,960
Do you want to stop seeing each other?

229
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,700
It doesn't matter how you say it.

230
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
But isn't the arranged date already over?

231
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,570
We lied to the president as well.

232
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,420
Things like getting married is out of the question.

233
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,970
Is this about what was said earlier?

234
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,080
You don't have any right to end the date.

235
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,970
But...

236
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,380
If you're going to fall for me...

237
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,800
Then feel free to back out.

238
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,680
Do you understand?

239
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:50,830
Now what?

240
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,780
What do you do after you pin me against the wall?

241
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,990
After?

242
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,460
Are you supposed to do something after the kabedon?

243
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,730
Geez! If you don't know what to do then don't do it!

244
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,580
That's so 2008.

245
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,250
There was a mosquito right next to your face and so I wanted to hit it!

246
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,060
Is it because someone here smells like curry?

247
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,540
You're pretty interesting Takane-san!

248
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,930
Interesting?

249
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,970
I'm a full fledged badass!

250
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,380
Open up those eyes and take a good look!

251
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,170
Oh that's right!

252
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,600
This is a little late but here is my thank you gift.

253
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,250
This is really popular right now.

254
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,950
What the heck is this?

255
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,060
Is that food?

256
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,650
Good night!

257
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,650
Isn't this rubber?

258
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,520
It's not bad.

259
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,920
Should I borrow this from my sister?

260
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,210
Isn't this a little too sudden?

261
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,970
That's going to scare away men isn't it?

262
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,350
Really?

263
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,160
I'm home!

264
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
Welcome home!

265
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,980
Hana. Takane-san is going to come and pick you up tomorrow right?

266
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
I'm going to go on a date with him!

267
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,000
What about your boyfriend?

268
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,010
I broke up with him!

269
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,890
That being said, I'm going to go after Takane-san with everything I've got!

270
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,200
You broke up!?

271
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,060
Are you serious Yukari? Alright!!

272
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,100
If you like someone that much can you really just end things like that?

273
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,870
Hana...

274
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,270
The time spent with another person isn't that long.

275
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,680
It would be a waste to let this opportunity pass us by right?

276
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,190
That being said Hana...

277
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,520
Good work!

278
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,540
I think that Takane-san is going to accept and marry me!

279
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,720
Is that so?

280
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,290
That means that everything is reset back to normal. Aren't you glad Hana?

281
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,700
Do you want to go to Okamoto's place again today?

282
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,680
Let's go! Let's go!

283
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,390
I want to hear about Hana's date too!

284
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,860
That's true! I wanna hear all about it!

285
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
It's going to be so fun!

286
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,230
Alright, we'll have the tempura with pork and shrimp! Please!

287
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,780
You're going to have that again?

288
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,530
We have a huge menu here!

289
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,180
Take a good luck at it!

290
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,080
I'm home.

291
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,530
Welcome home Okamoto!

292
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,060
Welcome home! Good work today!

293
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,520
You guys came again?

294
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,890
Souma! That's not what you say!

295
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,010
These are our precious guests after all!

296
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,920
It's fine! It's just them after all.

297
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,640
Don't say that!

298
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,470
Well...whatever.

299
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,240
It looks so yummy!

300
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,390
Go ahead!

301
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,790
It's hot so be careful.

302
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,600
Thanks for the food!

303
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,740
So how did the date with the hottie go?

304
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,090
He's an amazing person isn't he?

305
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,540
He's amazing?

306
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,370
He graduated from the Tokyo university.

307
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,090
Then he got an MBA at Harvard university.

308
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,680
And I heard that he is the heir to the big Takaba group!

309
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,320
You know your stuff.

310
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,660
I checked him out because I'm very curious.

311
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,050
It's Hana's first love.

312
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,670
He isn't my boyfriend!

313
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,480
You go on dates with him though!

314
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,520
They're not dates!

315
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,390
Is that right?

316
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,190
I think he's your type though Hana.

317
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,790
He's not my type at all!

318
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,320
He's a huge narcissist.

319
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,370
And he isn't interested in me at all.

320
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,760
Even though he brought you a ton of roses?

321
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,690
He doesn't know my name does he?

322
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,970
He never asked me!

323
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,200
That sounds pretty lonely.

324
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,770
He just thinks that I'm interesting because I didn't act in the way that he expected me too.

325
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,470
This is how rich people have fun. It's like a game to him.

326
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,120
Then you aren't going to see him anymore?

327
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,920
Of course not!

328
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
He's on a date with my older sister right now anyways.

329
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,120
Why?

330
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,850
I have no clue!

331
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,960
Well...he was a potential marriage partner for your older sister at first anyways.

332
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,620
Hana's older sister is a babe too!

333
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,760
A son from a rich family like him is a dime in a dozen.

334
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,030
Aren't you lucky that you got to meet him?

335
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,140
How am I lucky?

336
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,450
Being with that guy was a waste of time!

337
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,930
I'm glad that I don't have to see him anymore!

338
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,730
Don't worry.

339
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,680
You have your good points too.

340
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,110
I came out of my way to see you again.

341
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,040
Be more confident.

342
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,420
You have no right to end the date.

343
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,560
But...

344
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,640
If you're going to fall for me...then feel free to back out.

345
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,080
Do you understand?

346
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,600
Hana...

347
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,560
Did I say something that upset you?

348
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:03,980
No...

349
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,150
I wonder why?

350
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,640
Oh! It's this! It's this!

351
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,080
Okamo...

352
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,760
It seems like your cooking was so good today it brought me to tears.

353
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,270
What are you doing Okamoto?

354
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,320
That hurt...

355
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,420
She's laughing...

356
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,540
When someone is sad or worried, it's all in their head right?

357
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,650
But if you are distracted by something else then you won't think about it.

358
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,110
What kind of theory is that?

359
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,650
It is true that I had those kinds of thoughts.

360
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,740
It was just for a second though.

361
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,380
See?

362
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,680
It's been a while!

363
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,670
Do you want some more?

364
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,110
Go ahead! Go ahead!

365
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,950
Welcome!

366
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,520
Hey...why are you here?

367
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,110
What about you Takane-san?

368
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,700
What about my older sister?

369
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,030
I didn't have a potential marriage date with your older sister. I had one with you!

370
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,140
Sorry, just take this.

371
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,550
Let's go! Hurry up!

372
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,160
Hold on!

373
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,440
How is it?

374
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,400
I picked a place that I thought you would like.

375
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,180
My older sister probably rejected you huh?

376
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,450
It's not a surprise with that attitude you have.

377
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,200
I've never been rejected once in my life!

378
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,440
I was the one you were supposed to meet on that day.

379
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,640
But I was feeling sick and so I sent my little sister instead...

380
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,690
Please call your little sister over here.

381
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,160
She went out though...

382
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,920
What?

383
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,250
Like I said...I was the one that you were supposed to see...

384
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,610
I'm deeply sorry.

385
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,160
But I don't have the slightest interest in you at all!

386
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,010
But more importantly...where is your sister?

387
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,430
Like I said, you should accept me as your...

388
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,310
Hurry up and tell me!!

389
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,120
Yes!

390
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,470
You're bothering me!

391
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,630
Bothering you?

392
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,760
I mean...the way that you just do things on your own...

393
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,790
I understand your feelings!

394
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,360
Be honest.

395
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,000
How do you feel about me?

396
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,000
Su...su..su..

397
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
Su?

398
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,990
You're SU-per annoying!

399
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,320
How can you say that?

400
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,450
You're troublesome!

401
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,820
Are you even able to say something cute?

402
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,250
Takane-san.

403
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,380
You're a fool for worrying about me over my sister.

404
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,480
I don't need your pity.

405
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,790
There's no way someone like me would feel pity!

406
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,390
I'm interested in you.

407
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,270
Hana. That's your name right?

408
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,270
My name...

409
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,870
Stop teasing me!

410
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,130
On our potential marriage date you pretended to be your older sister who is 7 years older than you.

411
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,900
That is fraud!

412
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,530
You made me so mad that I ran out of there.

413
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,860
I gave you a rose bouquet.

414
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,890
I let you eat high quality steak.

415
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,930
But you wouldn't fall for me.

416
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,110
This is the first time I've had a woman make me this frustrated.

417
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,240
I'll show you what to do after you do a Kabedon.
